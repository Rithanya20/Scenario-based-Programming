/**
Alexander the great, while roaming the stretch of turkey, came across a wise man.
the wise man asked him to solve a puzzle 
the puzzle is "given two integers n1 and n2 select two integers a and b such
as to solve the equation (n1 * a + n2 * b = x) but there is a catch 'x' is the
smallest positive integer which satisfies the equation. 

n1 = 34818 n2 = 45632
n1 * a + n2 * b = x
34818 * 3553 + 45632 * (-2711) = 2
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int gcd(int a, int b){
    if(b==0){
        return a;
    }
    return gcd(b, a%b);
}
int main(){
    int a,b;
    cin>>a>>b;
    cout<<gcd(a,b);
    return 0;
}
